##IndexIgnore * 
## NC = No Case (not case sensitive, not really necessary since there are no characters in the pattern)
## L = Last (it'll stop rewriting at after this Rewrite so make sure it's the last thing in your list of rewrites)
## QSA = Query String Apend, just in case you've got something like ?like=penguins on the end which you want to keep and pass to index.php.
